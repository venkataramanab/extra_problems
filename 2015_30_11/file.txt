Newspapers often use short, idiomatic and dramatic words.
There may be abbreviations, omissions and puns. Sometimes this can lead to ambiguity.
Students can try to find the two possible meanings of these headlines and write a likely first sentence for the article following each headline.
For example:
POLICE HELP DOG BITE VICTIM
Meaning 1: The police have helped the victim of a dog-bite attack.
Meaning 2: The police helped a dog to bite someone.
Meaning 2 is the likely story.
